The app in `apps/desktop/src-tauri` is ring 3. It is the only place that knows Tauri.

## Dependency rule

A crate may depend only on crates in a lower ring. The allowed same-ring edges are `dp-versioned` to `dp-atomic`, `dp-kv` to `dp-versioned` and `dp-export` to `dp-atomic`. Each `Cargo.toml` declares its ring in `[package.metadata.dp]`, and the number must match the folder. `pnpm tiers:check` enforces this, including the ban on `tauri` outside ring 3, and it fails on an allowlist entry whose edge no longer exists. The allowlist sits at the top of `scripts/tiers.mjs`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` describes the rule under "Crate tiers".
