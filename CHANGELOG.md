# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Linux downloads (AppImage and deb) are now published with each release.
- The Linux app can update itself.

### Fixed

- Heroes released after the app last loaded its hero list now show their art in the app and in Discord, instead of a placeholder.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- The Live page, instant match results and Discord game status are now enabled on Linux. Some systems must allow memory reads first; the README explains how.

### Changed

- The Live page, Discord and match capture now share one connection to the game.
- The Live page uses less CPU.
- Background updates pause while the window is hidden.
- Frame capture uses far less CPU while recording.
- Background workers use less CPU when idle.
- The status bar is more compact.
- The Live page shows each game state, such as closed, menus and searching, in a card with an icon and a short hint.
- The Live page says "Reading the match" while player data loads, instead of showing nothing useful.

### Removed

- macOS support. Nobody could test it, and the game reader does not support it.
- Hero Labs, which no longer exists in the game, is gone from Discord and the Live page.
- The "Hero select" Discord status is gone, including its editor entry. We could not read the hero select screen reliably, and it also showed on the post-game scoreboard.

### Fixed

- The Live page updates even when no Steam account is signed in.

#### Discord status

- Discord shows "Finding match" again when you search solo.
- Discord correctly shows the game mode you are searching for, such as Ranked or Street Brawl.
- Discord shows the Sandbox and Explore NYC instead of "Main menu" or "Hideout".
- Discord shows "Setting up a bot match" while you start a private bot match.
- A private match against only bots shows as a bot match on Discord.
- Discord keeps your last status for up to 30 seconds while a map loads instead of flashing "Playing Deadlock".

#### Game performance

- Deadlock+ no longer lowers your FPS when the game starts.
- Deadlock+ uses less CPU in the menus, so it no longer lowers your FPS there.
- Deadlock+ no longer causes FPS drops while you sit in the Hideout.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- The status bar shows your Discord presence state. Click it to open Discord settings.
- The status bar shows your live match: searching, starting, in match with the clock, paused or finished. Click it to open Live.

### Changed

- The Live page subtitle and description now mention both teams.

### Fixed

- Closing the app no longer fails while sending the final usage report.


## [0.9.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- Settings has a Thanks page for contributors, translators and donators.

#### Live match

- Live shows both teams during a match: heroes, ranks, souls, K/D/A, damage and healing, with team totals.
- Hover a player to open their Steam profile or Statlocker page.
- When a player switches hero after pregame, a notice lists the change and the player's row is marked.
- The connection section lists each match's average and worst ping, with the server.
- A one-line status above the connection shows what the game is doing: reading off, game closed, menus, queuing, pregame, in match or post-match.

#### Telemetry

- Deadlock+ now sends ANONYMOUS usage data and error reports, so the team can see how many people use it and what breaks.
- It is on by default. New installs are told in the setup, and existing users get a one-time notice.
- Turn it off in Settings > Privacy. Nothing is sent after that.
- It uses a random install ID. Settings > Privacy can reset it.
- It never sends your Steam ID, paths, names, IP address or match data. The README lists exactly what is sent.

### Changed

- Instant match results are now always enabled.
- The Connection page has been turned into a Live page. It shows your connection details underneath information about the match in progress.

### Fixed

- Lowered CPU use from reading the game: party lookups now pause during matches and run less often in menus.
- Live no longer shows a server running on your own machine as your game server.
- Pages no longer shift sideways when you switch between pages with and without a scrollbar.
- Your Steam account is now detected on setups where it was missing, so it shows in the app again.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

#### Discord activity

- Deadlock+ can show on your Discord profile while Deadlock is running. It is off by default.
- Turn it on in Settings > Discord.
- Pick which Discord clients get it: Stable, PTB, Canary or others. All are selected by default.
- Settings shows which Discord clients are running right now.
- Choose Basic or Detailed. Detailed shows your hideout, mode, hero and match timer by reading the game.
- A "Download Deadlock+" button is added to your activity by default. Turn it off with Support Deadlock+ in Settings > Discord.

#### Discord activity editor

- Settings > Discord has an editor for every line of your activity.
- Change the top line, bottom line, hover text, images and timer for each state.
- Give a state variants, such as ranked or Street Brawl, and a different line for a chosen hero.
- Lines can use placeholders like {hero}, {kills}, {deaths}, {assists} and {souls}.
- Pick a hero once at the top to edit that hero's lines across every state.
- Turn a state or variant on or off with the switch on its row.
- Optional groups like [[Playing as {hero}]] disappear when a value is missing, and `||` adds fallbacks.
- A Template syntax card at the bottom explains placeholders, groups and fallbacks with live examples.
- {partySize}, {partyMax} and {queueTime} show your party and queue while you look for a match.
- Finding a match has lines per queue mode, and a Hideout party has its own line.

- {matchId} is available for your own lines, and is never used by a built-in line.
- Your hero icon is the big image on your Discord card wherever a hero is known.
- Your rank badge is the small image in ranked matches. Other states have no small image.
- Hover text shows your hero and rank, and {rank} is a new variable.
- Spectating and private lobbies send no hero or rank art unless you turn it on.
- The preview shows the real art.
- {heroPresence} inserts your hero's own hideout line, like "Plotting in the Hideout".
- Discord shows your party count, like (2 of 6), when you are in a party of two or more.
- A Party size switch on each state turns the count off.
- Street Brawl has its own Round state, and {round}, {scoreAmber} and {scoreSapphire} show the round and score.
- Custom image URLs must be https and under 256 characters.
- See a live preview of the card, reset any field, and import or export your setup as JSON.
- Your own kills, deaths, assists and souls are never shown while you spectate.

### Changed

- Community translations from Crowdin are updated for all 19 languages.

### Fixed

- Text in Cyrillic, Thai, Chinese, Japanese and Korean now uses a matching font instead of a mismatched fallback.
- Polish, Czech, Hungarian and Turkish letters now use a Deadlock+ font instead of a plain system font.
- Line spacing is taller for Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Thai so characters are not cramped.

- A Deadlock API status item in the status bar. It shows online, degraded or offline.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- A notification tells you when a block was updated, or needs re-applying.
- Background work: an "Updating server blocks" task you can turn off.

### Fixed

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- Performance page with an addon script scan. It flags patterns that can hurt frametimes, such as timers that pile up. Results are hints, not proof.
- Frametimes: record Deadlock's frame pacing while you play. Shows average FPS, 1% and 0.1% lows, percentiles and stutter spikes. Time spent tabbed out is excluded.
- Save a frametime run with a label, then compare two runs side by side.
- Patch note indexing and addon scans pause while Deadlock runs and resume when you close it.
- Background work setting: allow background work, pause while Deadlock runs, and per job (addon scan, patch note indexing) run by itself and choose keep running, pause or slow down while Deadlock runs.
- Storage rows show a badge (regenerates, history, backup, yours or managed by mods), what clearing does, item count, age and a size bar.
- Storage lists saved frametime runs with their size and a link to Performance.
- Storage: Show paths toggle and a Clear regenerable button for the shader cache and console log.
- The status bar shows "paused while Deadlock runs" with a Run now button. A scan you start yourself runs right away.

### Changed

- Storage is grouped by owner: Deadlock, Deadlock+, mods and backups. Rows are sorted by size.
- Storage splits "Deadlock+ data" into Settings, Server presets, Replay pins and cleanup rules, Connection history, Alerts and notifications, Patch notes index, Stats cache, Server list cache, Replay info cache and Other app files.
- Storage: "Deadlock+ logs" is now "App logs".
- Home: the Tools list is centered, so a short last row sits in the middle.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- Deadlock+ now checks for updates periodically while it's open, not just at launch, so a release doesn't go unnoticed during a long session.
- A notification bell in the title bar collects patch/news alerts and maintenance reminders in one place.
- Notifications can be marked read individually or all at once.
- The tray and taskbar icons show a green badge when an update is available.
- The tray and taskbar icons show a red badge with an unread notification count.

### Fixed

- Patch notes: images now show at the same spot they appear in the real post, instead of always at the top, and can be clicked to view full-size.
- Patch notes: a bold section heading like "General" no longer shows up as literal bolded text (`**[ General ]**`).
- The maintenance reminder no longer fires again if the app restarts while already inside the lead window.
- Stats: a leaderboard-tracked hero with no games in the current filter now shows its lifetime game count instead of just "No games in this selection."

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- Search patch notes from the Updates page, going all the way back to October 2024 — find a change even if you only remember roughly what it said, not the exact wording.
- A big, full-width search bar on the Updates page.
- Search results show whether an update came from Steam or the forums.
- Search waits for patch notes to finish indexing in the background before showing results, so you don't get an incomplete list.
- View full patch notes for an update, with images where available. Forum-only updates without a full body show the forum's short preview instead, with a link to read the rest there.
- Two new themes: Nightshift (teal cyberpunk noir with amber trim) and Deadlock API (OLED black with electric red glow).
- Status bar shows progress while new patch notes are being indexed, including which one is currently being processed.
- Storage page: clear Deadlock+'s own log files with a new `Logs` entry.

### Fixed

- Status bar items are now separated by a dot when several show at once.
- The main window no longer sits empty for a couple of seconds after launching.
- Some updates in the Updates list showed the wrong date and sorted out of order.

### Changed

- The Server Picker remembers its sort column and direction across page changes and restarts.

- Server Picker columns sort on click: Region, Direct ping and Blocked. Click again to reverse. Default is Region A-Z.
- Server Picker shows a warning banner while Deadlock is running: restart the game after changing blocks.
- New installs start with six Server Picker presets: Asia, EU All, EU West, USA, USA East and ZA. They are ordinary presets: edit or delete them, and they do not come back.

First release. Windows only.

### Added

- Window size and position are remembered.
